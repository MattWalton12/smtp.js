##What is smtp.js?

smtp.js is my leightweight SMTP server created entirely in Javascript. It is the base of a secure email platform that I am currently developing, that will be released at a later date.

##Documentation
Documentation will be available at a later date, once the module has been fully tested and proven to be stable. If you wish to use it for now, just include the init.js and follow the code in example.js
